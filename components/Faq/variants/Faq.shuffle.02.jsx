                     How does Dunder Mifflin paper differ from

                     Paper produced with love, devotion, passion
                     - is not the same paper. Our supplies are
                     extra strong, and you’re going to need the
                     paper-tear up-master to destroy just one
                     sheet. It’s also suited for every available
                     printer.

                  <p>
                     If you buy one of our business plans, you
                     will receive the supplies every first Monday
                     of the month. However, you can also purchase
                     paper separately. Our employees will make
                     sure that you will receive the products in
                     the next business days.

                     Why choose Dunder Mifflin instead of some

                     You know that feeling when you are waiting
                     on the phone for hours to contact your
                     supplier? Sometimes they even have a waiting
                     time music prepared for that. In Dunder
                     Mifflin, you can get help immediately, and
                     each of our customers receives an individual
                     assistant.
